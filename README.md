## Mandatory Ownership Proof (DMI Rule)
Before you deploy, you MUST edit the footer and add your details:

Original:

```html
<p>Crafted with <span>cloud</span> excellence by Pravin Mishra</p>
```

Add this line (example):

```html
<p><strong>Deployed by:</strong> DMI Cohort 2 | Rahul Sharma | Group 4 | Week 1 | 16-01-2026</p>
```

✅ This proof must be visible in your browser screenshot submission.

## Footer Deployment Date

The footer displays a dynamic deployment date instead of a hard-coded value.
The date is generated at runtime using vanilla JavaScript and formatted as DD Mon YYYY.

**Snippet**
```html 
<p>Deployed on <span id="deployDate"></span></p>

<script>
  document.getElementById('deployDate').textContent =
    new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-GB',
      { day: '2-digit', month: 'short', year: 'numeric' });
</script>
```
